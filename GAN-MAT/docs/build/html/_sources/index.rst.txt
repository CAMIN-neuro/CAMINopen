GAN-MAT is pipeline for analysis microstructural profile covariance (MPC) without T2-weight MRI. This pipeline synthesizes T2-weight MRI from T1-weight MRI using generative adversarial network (GAN) and provides T2-weight MRI, myelin image, MPC matrix, MPC gradients. See `our paper <https:paper_link>`_ for more details.
